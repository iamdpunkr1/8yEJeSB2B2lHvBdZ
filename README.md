# React + Vite + Typescript App

This repository contains a React application scaffolded with Vite.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js installation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iampunkr1/8yEJeSB2B2lHvBdZ.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 8yEJeSB2B2lHvBdZ
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

To start the development server and run the app locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser. The development server supports hot module replacement, so changes to your code will automatically refresh the browser.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory containing optimized and minified assets that are ready for deployment.
